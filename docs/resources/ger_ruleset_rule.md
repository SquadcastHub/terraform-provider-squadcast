# squadcast_ger_ruleset_rule (Resource)

GER Ruleset Rules are a set of conditions defined within a Global Event Ruleset. These rules have expressions, whose evaluation will determine the destination service for the incoming events.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "squadcast_team" "example_team" {
  name = "Example Team"
}

data "squadcast_user" "example_user" {
  email = "john@example.com"
}

data "squadcast_service" "example_service" {
  name = "Example Service"
  team_id = data.squadcast_team.example_team.id
}

resource "squadcast_ger" "example_ger" {
  name = "Example GER"
  description = "Example GER Description"
  team_id =   data.squadcast_team.example_team.id
  entity_owner {
    id = data.squadcast_user.example_user.id
    type = "user"
  }
}

resource "squadcast_ger_ruleset" "example_ger_ruleset" {
    ger_id = squadcast_ger.example_ger.id
    alert_source = "Prometheus"
    catch_all_action = {
        "route_to": data.squadcast_service.example_service.id
    }
}

resource "squadcast_ger_ruleset_rule" "example_ger_ruleset_rule" {
    ger_id = squadcast_ger.example_ger.id
    alert_source = squadcast_ger_ruleset.example_ger_ruleset.alert_source
    expression = "alertname == \"DeploymentReplicasNotUpdated\""
    description = "Example GER Ruleset Rule"
    action = {
        "route_to": data.squadcast_service.example_service.id
    }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `action` (Map of String) Rule Action refers to the designated destination service to which an event should be directed towards, whenever a rule expression is true.
- `alert_source` (String) An alert source refers to the origin of an event (alert), such as a monitoring tool. These alert sources are associated with specific rules in GER, determining where events from each source should be routed. Find all alert sources supported on Squadcast [here](https://www.squadcast.com/integrations).
- `description` (String) GER Ruleset Rule description.
- `expression` (String) An expression is a single condition or a set of conditions that must be met for the rule to take action, such as routing the incoming event to a specific service.
- `ger_id` (String) GER id.

### Read-Only

- `alert_source_shortname` (String) Shortname of the linked alert source.
- `alert_source_version` (String) Version of the linked alert source.
- `id` (String) GER Ruleset rule id.
