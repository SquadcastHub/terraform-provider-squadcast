# squadcast_routing_rules (Resource)

[Routing rules](https://support.squadcast.com/docs/alert-routing) allows you to ensure that alerts are routed to the right responder with the help of `event tags` attached to them.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "squadcast_team" "example_resource_name" {
  name = "example team name"
}

data "squadcast_user" "example_resource_name" {
  email = "test@example.com"
}

data "squadcast_service" "example_resource_name" {
  name = "example service name"
}

data "squadcast_escalation_policy" "example_resource_name" {
  name = "example escalation policy name"
}

data "squadcast_squad" "example_resource_name" {
  name = "example squad name"
}

resource "squadcast_routing_rules" "example_resource_name" {
  team_id    = data.squadcast_team.example_resource_name.id
  service_id = data.squadcast_service.example_resource_name.id

  rules {
    is_basic   = false
    expression = "payload[\"event_id\"] == 40"

    route_to_id   = data.squadcast_user.example_resource_name.id / data.squadcast_squad.example_resource_name.id / data.squadcast_escalation_policy.example_resource_name.id
    route_to_type = "user/squad/escalation_policy"
  }

  rules {
    is_basic = true

    basic_expressions {
      lhs = "payload[\"foo\"]"
      rhs = "bar"
    }

    route_to_id   = data.squadcast_user.example_resource_name.id / data.squadcast_squad.example_resource_name.id / data.squadcast_escalation_policy.example_resource_name.id
    route_to_type = "user/squad/escalation_policy"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `rules` (Block List, Min: 1) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--rules))
- `service_id` (String) Service id.
- `team_id` (String) Team id.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) id.

<a id="nestedblock--rules"></a>
### Nested Schema for `rules`

Required:

- `is_basic` (Boolean) is_basic will be true when users use the drop down selectors which will have lhs, op & rhs value, whereas it will be false when they use the advanced mode and it would have the expression for it's value
- `route_to_id` (String) The id of the entity (user, escalation policy, squad) for which we are routing this incident.
- `route_to_type` (String) Type of the entity for which we are routing this incident - User, Escalation Policy or Squad

Optional:

- `basic_expressions` (Block List) The basic expression which needs to be evaluated to be true for this rule to apply. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--rules--basic_expressions))
- `expression` (String) The expression which needs to be evaluated to be true for this rule to apply.

<a id="nestedblock--rules--basic_expressions"></a>
### Nested Schema for `rules.basic_expressions`

Required:

- `lhs` (String) left hand side dropdown value
- `rhs` (String) right hand side value

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# teamID:serviceID
# Use 'Get All Teams' and 'Get All Services' APIs to get the id of the team and service respectively 
terraform import squadcast_routing_rules.test 62d2fe23a57381088224d726:62da76c088f407f9ca756ca5
