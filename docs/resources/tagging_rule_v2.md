# squadcast_tagging_rule_v2 (Resource)

[Tagging](https://support.squadcast.com/docs/event-tagging) is a rule-based, auto-tagging system with which you can define customised tags based on incident payloads, that get automatically assigned to incidents when they are triggered.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "squadcast_service" "example_service" {
  name = "example service name"
  team_id = data.squadcast_team.example_team.id
}

resource "squadcast_tagging_rule_v2" "example_tagging_rule" {
  service_id = data.squadcast_service.example_service.id

  is_basic   = false
  expression = "payload[\"event_id\"] == 40"  
  tags {
    key   = "MyTag"
    value = "foo"
    color = "#ababab"
  }
  tags {
    key   = "MyTag2"
    value = "bar"
    color = "#f0f0f0"
  }
}

resource "squadcast_tagging_rule_v2" "example_basic_tagging_rule" {
  service_id = data.squadcast_service.example_service.id
  is_basic = true
  basic_expressions {
    lhs = "payload[\"foo\"]"
    op  = "is"
    rhs = "bar"
  }
  tags {
    key   = "MyTag"
    value = "foo"
    color = "#ababab"
  }
}


# addTags must be set in expression when tags are not passed
resource "squadcast_tagging_rule_v2" "example_tagging_rules_resource_withouttags" {
  service_id = data.squadcast_service.example_service.id
  is_basic   = false
  expression = "addTag(\"EventType\", payload.details.event_type_key, \"#037916\")"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `is_basic` (Boolean) is_basic will be true when users use the drop down selectors which will have lhs, op & rhs value, whereas it will be false when they use the advanced mode and it would have the expression for it's value
- `service_id` (String) Service id.

### Optional

- `basic_expressions` (Block List) The basic expression which needs to be evaluated to be true for this rule to apply. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--basic_expressions))
- `expression` (String) The expression which needs to be evaluated to be true for this rule to apply.
- `tags` (Block List) The tags supposed to be set for a given payload(incident), Expression must be set when tags are empty and must contain addTags parameters. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--tags))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) id.

<a id="nestedblock--basic_expressions"></a>
### Nested Schema for `basic_expressions`

Required:

- `lhs` (String) left hand side dropdown value
- `op` (String) operator (is, is_not, matches, not_contains)
- `rhs` (String) right hand side value


<a id="nestedblock--tags"></a>
### Nested Schema for `tags`

Required:

- `color` (String) Tag color, hex values
- `key` (String) key
- `value` (String) value

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# serviceID:ruleID
terraform import squadcast_tagging_rule_v2.test 62d2fe23a57381088224d726:62da76c088f407f9ca756ca5
```
