# squadcast_ger_ruleset_rules_ordering (Resource)

The ordering of rules within a Ruleset dictates the sequence in which rules are evaluated for an alert source. These rules are evaluated sequentially, starting from the top.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "squadcast_team" "example_team" {
  name = "Example Team"
}

data "squadcast_service" "example_service" {
  name = "Example Service"
  team_id = data.squadcast_team.example_team.id
}

resource "squadcast_ger" "example_ger" {
  name = "Example GER"
  description = "Example GER Description"
  team_id =   data.squadcast_team.example_team.id
  entity_owner {
    id = data.squadcast_team.example_team.id
    type = "team"
  }
}

resource "squadcast_ger_ruleset" "example_ger_ruleset" {
    ger_id = squadcast_ger.example_ger.id
    alert_source = "Prometheus"
    catch_all_action = {
        "route_to": data.squadcast_service.example_service.id
    }
}

resource "squadcast_ger_ruleset_rule" "example_ger_ruleset_rule_1" {
    ger_id = squadcast_ger.example_ger.id
    alert_source = squadcast_ger_ruleset.example_ger_ruleset.alert_source
    expression = "alertname == \"DeploymentReplicasNotUpdated\""
    description = "Example GER Ruleset Rule"
    action = {
        "route_to": data.squadcast_service.example_service.id
    }
}

resource "squadcast_ger_ruleset_rule" "example_ger_ruleset_rule_2" {
    ger_id = squadcast_ger.example_ger.id
    alert_source = squadcast_ger_ruleset.example_ger_ruleset.alert_source
    expression = "component == \"kube-state-metrics\""
    description = "Example GER Ruleset Rule"
    action = {
        "route_to": data.squadcast_service.example_service.id
    }
}

resource "squadcast_ger_ruleset_rules_ordering" "rule_ordering" {
    ger_id = squadcast_ger.ger.id
    alert_source = squadcast_ger_ruleset.ger_ruleset_1.alert_source
    ordering = [
        squadcast_ger_ruleset_rule.ger_ruleset_rule_2.id,
        squadcast_ger_ruleset_rule.ger_ruleset_rule_1.id,
    ]
}

These alert sources are associated with specific rules in GER, determining where events from each source should be routed. Find all alert sources supported on Squadcast [here](https://www.squadcast.com/integrations).
- `ger_id` (String) GER id.
- `ordering` (List of String) GER Ruleset Rule Ordering.

### Read-Only

- `alert_source_shortname` (String) Shortname of the linked alert source.
- `alert_source_version` (String) Version of the linked alert source.
- `id` (String) GER Ruleset id.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# gerID:alertSourceName
terraform import squadcast_ger_ruleset_rule_ordering.example_ger_ruleset_rule_ordering_import "53:Grafana"
```
